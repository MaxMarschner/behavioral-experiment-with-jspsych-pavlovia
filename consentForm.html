                <b>Procedure.</b> You will be asked to complete a computer task in which you will play a card game together with a virtual partner. 
                The game involves performing simple keypresses on your key-board in response to images that appear on your computer screen. 
                If you decide to participate, you will receive more detailed instruction about the game. The study will take about 15 minutes to complete.
